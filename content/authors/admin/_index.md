I am currently in my second year of pursuing a Ph.D. at Stanford University under the guidance of Professor Serena Yeung. My research is dedicated to the development and evaluation of multimodal vision language models tailored for practical applications in the realms of medical and biomedical sciences.

During my undergraduate years, I had the privilege of being mentored by Professor Isaac Chairez and collaborated closely with Professor David Cruz and Mariana Ballesteros. My focus during this time was on non-linear and constrained control design, particularly within the context of medical rehabilitation.

I am grateful for the enriching experiences I've had, thanks to the guidance and collaboration of various mentors and collaborators. Notably, I had the opportunity to work with Professors Chris Butch from Nanjing University, Henderson Cleeves from Tokyo Institute of Technology, and Boswell Wing from the University of Colorado, Boulder. Their insights have significantly contributed to shaping my academic journey and research pursuits.
