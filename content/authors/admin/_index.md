I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Biomedical Informatics at Stanford University generously funded by [Arc Institute](https://arcinstitute.org/) and advised by Professor [Serena Yeung-Levy](https://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/). My research is dedicated to developing and evaluating multimodal vision-language models tailored to precision medicine, positioned at the intersection of medicine and biology. 


I hold a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering. During my undergraduate years, I had the privilege of being mentored by Professor [Isaac Chairez](https://iamsm-conference.tec.mx/en/speakers/jorge-isaac-chairez) and collaborated closely with Professor [David Cruz](https://ipn.elsevierpure.com/en/persons/david-cruz-ortiz)  and [Mariana Ballesteros](https://ipn.elsevierpure.com/es/persons/mariana-felisa-ballesteros-escamilla). My research focus during this time was on non-linear control design and its applications to medical rehabilitation. I also had the opportunity to work on chemo-informatics with Professors [Chris Butch](https://eng.nju.edu.cn/CHRISTOPHER%20JOSEPH%20BUTCH/mainm.psp) from Nanjing University, [Henderson Cleeves](https://www.ias.edu/scholars/henderson-jim-cleaves) from Advance Studies, and [Boswell Wing](https://www.colorado.edu/geologicalsciences/boswell-wing) from the University of Colorado, Boulder.
